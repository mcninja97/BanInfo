ITWS-1100 Term Project by Ryan McDonnell and Maya Tung

A webpage and database to track steam users and their friends list to see if anyone is banned and if so what type.

Use init.sql to create databse with tables, then edit results.php and info.php to connect to your database. Change the host username and password variables.
Load homepage.html and enter a steam ID and it will take you to the results page.
The database will be updated as new steam ID's are entered into homepage.html.
If you do not have access to steam usernames or IDs, you can view the current state of our database through exported_database.sql and use the steamid64 field to enter in users.
